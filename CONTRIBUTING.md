# Contributor guidelines

First off, thank you for considering contributing to 2Smart. It's people like 
you that make 2Smart such a great tool.

You can use this project to add your devices to 2Smart Modbus Bridge. 
We have developed the features to make your contributions as easy as we can.
If you need to add your device, but for any reason cannot make a pull request by yourself,
create an issue and we will consider adding support for the device in on of the future releases.
Please, keep in mind that we will be able to add device(requested by you) only if are able 

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of 
the developers managing and developing this project. In return, 
they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, 
and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Branch Organization
Submit all changes directly to the master branch. We don’t use separate branches for development or for upcoming releases. We do our best to keep master in good shape, with all tests passing.

Code that lands in master must be compatible with the latest stable release. It may contain additional features, but no breaking changes. We should be able to release a new minor version from the tip of master at any time.

## Bugs
### Where to Find Known Issues
We are using GitHub Issues for our public bugs. We keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new task, try to make sure your problem doesn’t already exist.
